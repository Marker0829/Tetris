How to Play:Fill the well up with the Tetrimino blocks. If you do not like the current Tetrimino in play, you can hold (or store)that Tetrimino for later use. Once you want to use thatTetrimino again, press the same key to switch it back.This action can only be done once per Tetrimino dropped,so you can not continuously swap the Tetrimino's to get yourself back up to the top. When you completely fill a row with Tetrimino blocks, that line clears out and you get points. Clear four lines with one Tetriminoand you get 4x the amount of normal points! Try to survive as long as possible, as once the Tetriminos reachthe top, the game is over! Also be careful, as you clearmore rows, the Tetrimino will begin to fall faster. Havefun!Controls: Left Arrow ========= Move LeftRight Arrow ======== Move RightDown Arrow ========= Move DownUp Arrow =========== Rotate the TetriminoSpacebar =========== Drop the TetriminoRight Shift ======== Hold (Store) the TetriminoScore:It is calculated as follows:	Normal Calculation           = currentLevel * 10 * rowsCleared	Four Rows in One Calculation = 4 * (currentLevel * 10 * rowsCleared)
